## Personal

I have interests, it's true. In no particular order, here are a few:

* Solving problems
* Flying - currently licensed with a single-engine land class rating
* Playing golf
* Solving problems
* Sleeping
* Waking up
* Solving problems

I live in downtown Bloomington, Indiana, with [Kate](https://www.kategalvin.com/) and _JEFF!_.

## Professional

*The Past:* Way back in the year 2000, I cofounded [Resite Information Technology](http://resiteit.com/). Amazingly as of this writing, that site remains up. After selling the company in 2007, the name was changed to [Resite Online](http://www.resiteonline.com/). That's right, "online."

*The Present:* In 2009, as a cofounder of [SproutBox](http://sproutbox.com), I founded [GetCheddar, Inc](https://www.getcheddar.com).

*The Future:* I'm not really sure. You can help define this.
